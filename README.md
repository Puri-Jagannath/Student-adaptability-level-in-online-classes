# Student-adaptability-level-in-online-classes
A Logistic regression model to determine whether a student can get adapted to online classes or not.

As all the industries, fields has to suspend their offline services due to the pandemic(Covid19), they gradually started shifting towards online. There is a larger shift in educational and financial landscapes.

So, our target is...
To determine whether a student can get adapted to online classes or not.

The attributes are...
Attributes
  ➢ Gender 
  ➢ Age
  ➢ Education Level
  ➢ Institution Type
  ➢ IT Student
  ➢ Load-shedding
  ➢ Financial Condition
  ➢ Internet Type
  ➢ Network Type
  ➢ Class Duration
  ➢ Self LMS
  ➢ Device
 Total 1205 records with 12 attributes
 
Dependent variable - Adaptivity Level

Output classes - High, Moderate, Low

Application : If a university has n number of students and the faculty can determine how many of them can adjust to online classes. And they can plan whether to go online or offline.

A logistic classification model takes all the data points and the feature values associated with each feature and feeds these inputs to the Algorithm which in turn gives us an output in form of probabilities and the number of these probabilities is equal to number of classes.

This is a Polytomous classification i.e, the outcome can be more then two classes.

Ex 1 : Which stream will be chosen by student in E3 Sem 1?
1 Data Mining
2 Distributed Computing
3 Android app development

Ex 2 : Which Item will be served in dinner tonight?
1 Chapati
2 Biryani
3 Rice

Let’s say - there are three classes of outcome A, B and C . Model develops three models separately. It builds equations for three probabilities. P(A), P(B) and P(C).
and define any record to the class, based on the input variables, which has highest probability.
Like if P(A) > P(B) and P(A) > P(C) then outcome = Class A
